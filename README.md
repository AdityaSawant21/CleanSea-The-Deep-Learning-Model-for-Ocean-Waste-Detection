# Cleansea : The Deep Learning Model for Ocean Waste Detection
This Project will tackle problem of waste pollution by focusing on developing a model that uses images of trash from the epipelagic layer of the ocean to identifies the Ocean waste. Our System also detects the ocean waste hotspots in the ocean.
## Solution: 
- We are working on a system which can detect many different types of trash in the ocean i.e. Plastic, Glass, Metal, Paper,Trash and Cardboard.
- We are working on combined datasets from various sources in large amount for the proposed system.
- Our System is cost effective as it only requires basic working Pc.

## Task Accuracy :
- Our system has 94% Training accuracy and 92% Testing accuracy.
