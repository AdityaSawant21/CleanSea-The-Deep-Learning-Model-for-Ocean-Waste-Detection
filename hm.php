<p>The global Marine plastic Pollution footprint is estimated to be 8-10 million tonnes annuallyâ€”equivalent to dumping one truck of garbage into the ocean every minute.
 A rough estimate suggests that close to 150 million tonnes (mt) of plastics have already polluted our oceans, and most of it originates from land 
(that is, it is not dumped into the ocean directly from vessels etc). Plastic packaging accounts for more than 62% of all items (including non-plastics) 
collected in international coastal clean-up initiatives. The number looks worse with the World Economic Forum estimating that 32% of all single-use packaging 
escapes collection systems.</p>

<p>Currently, India is considered the twelfth-largest source of marine litter and is projected to become the fifth-largest by 2025. 
The Ganga has been documented as one of the top-five rivers dumping plastics into oceans. India, as per 2017-18 estimates,
 consumes 16.5 mt of plastic annually, 43% of which was towards the manufacture of single-use plastic material. The Covid-19 outbreak has exacerbated this situation, 
with the pandemic demanding the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as suits, masks and gloves that are often discarded in unscientific ways. 
With our country generating close to 101 tonnes/ day of Covid-19-related biomedical waste, the need to handle this stream of waste has grown significantly.</p>

As per Material Recycling Association (MRAI) India's recycling rates stands at 30%. The data associated with this recycling rate is largely 
dominated by highly recyclable materials such as ferrous & non-ferrous scrap, paper, rubber, and tyre etc.
 Recycling of materials such as plastics is not very well documented. </p> <br> <br>
